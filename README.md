## Testing

The easiest way to test the function of the application would be to click on the link to the deployed app on Heroku. You should be able to Add and devour burgers and see the page respond accordingly. The more difficult way to test would be to git clone the repository, add the schema and seeds files to your mysql workbench, and change the password in the connection.js file. Then go to the terminal and type in node server.js, you should see "APP listening on PORT: 8080". Go to your browser and type in "localhost:8080", this will launch the app, and you should be able to follow the same steps as the deployed version to test the app.
